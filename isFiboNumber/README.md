# Check If Num is a Part of the Fibonacci Sequence

- Write a function `FibonacciChecker` which accepts a number and returns yes if the number is in the fibonacci sequence and returns no if it is not.

- This sequence is defined by: Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2, which means to find Fn you add the previous two numbers up. The first two numbers are 0 and 1, then comes 1, 2, 3, 5 etc. If num is not in the Fibonacci sequence, return the string 'no'.

## Examples:
```javascript
FibonacciChecker(34)
    => yes
FibonacciChecker(54)
    => yes
```
