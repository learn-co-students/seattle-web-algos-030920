# Daily Programming Problems
This repo contains daily programming problems. These challenges should further
your understanding of programming languages, data structures, and algorithms.

Every day someone will receive a programming problem. They'll have a day to work
on it during their own time. The next day we will all gather to review the problem.
The one person designated to present will write their solution on the whiteboard.
They will discuss their solution. Whoever presents their solution each day gets to
pick the next problem for everyone to work on. Although only one person will present
each day everyone should still work on each problem.

Fork this repo and code your solutions there. Do not make pull requests back to
this repo. You can code your solutions in your own forked repo and never pull
from this repo again. Staff is able to view your forked repos and your solutions
without you making pull requests back.

This repo will be updated daily. You can view this original repo in your
browser to refer to new daily problem definitions. You shouldn't need to pull
changes made in this repo into your repo. You'll simply read problems here
and create solutions for them in your own repo.

Have fun!
